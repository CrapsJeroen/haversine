# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0 - 2018-10-10

No changes, haversine package has been stable and functional for years now. Time to make a 1.0 version :)

(in fact there is one breaking changes but it concern the 0.5.0 version published just 10 minutes before 1.0 ;). In that case `nmiles` has been changed to `nautical_miles` for readability)

## 0.5.0 - 2018-10-10

Add nautical miles support

## 0.4.6

Fixed typos in README and docstring

## 0.4.5

Fixed issue with int instead of float [#6](https://github.com/mapado/haversine/pull/6/files)

## 0.4.3 - 0.4.4

- Remove useless code [#5](https://github.com/mapado/haversine/pull/5)

## 0.4.2
